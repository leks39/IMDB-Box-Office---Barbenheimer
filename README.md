# IMDB-Box-Office---Barbenheimer
It is summertime again, that time of the year when we all troop to the cinema waiting for the next box office blockbuster release. The summer of 2023 created a new internet phenomenon called Barbenheimer when two of the year's most anticipated movies, Barbie and Oppenheimer, were released on the same day, Friday, 21st of July 2023. The simultaneous release of two movies targeting different demographics, known as counterprogramming, is not uncommon in Hollywood. However, the peculiarity of Barbenheimer was that moviegoers planned to watch both, increasing the footfall and ticket sales at the cinemas. So far, opening weekend numbers for both movies have been Barbie (USD155mn) and Oppenheimer (USD80.5mn), making them the 25th and 113th highest first-week movie ticket sales ever.

A project idea emerged to capture the box office buzz that has taken over the internet all week. I decided to analyze the 1000 top box office movies ever with visualizations in Tableau. Also, a regression analysis will be run on Python to predict the total box office sales of moving from their first-week ticket sales.

Data for this project was sourced from Box Office Mojo by IMDBPro Movie details on the website were scrapped using the ParseHub, a free web scraping tool and then saved as a CSV file. Data cleaning was carried out in Python.
